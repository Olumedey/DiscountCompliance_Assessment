# Rogers Discount Compliance Assessment
This is a solution set (Python Code, Tableau Dashboard, and Recommendation Presentation) for a second-round assessment given to me while applying for a Sr. Revenue Analyst role at Rogers Telecommunications. 

## Base Datasets
- sample_discount_data.xlsx
- data_dictionary.txt

## Goal/Business Case
Submit any revenue, and compliance insights or business recommendations inferred from the base dataset. Deliverables should include a presentation of findings and a high-level dashboard-style slide. 

## Solution Approach
The job description heavily highlighted proficiencies with SQL, Python, and Tableau (or Power BI). I approached the data cleaning and transformations using Python (Jupyter Notebook),  mostly using the `pandas` library and created visualizations on Tableau. Please see the attached `pptx.` file for a summary of compliance findings and business improvement recommendations.
