# A Discount Compliance Assessment
This is a solution set (Python Code, [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/rogers_assess_sample/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link), and Recommendation Presentation) for a second-round assessment given to me while applying for a Sr. Revenue Analyst role at Rogers Telecommunications. 

## Base Datasets
- sample_discount_data.xlsx
- data_dictionary.txt

## Goal/Business Case
To submit any revenue and compliance insights, or business recommendations inferred from the base dataset. Deliverables should include a presentation of findings and a high-level dashboard-style slide. 

## Solution Approach
The job description heavily highlighted proficiencies with SQL, Python, and Tableau (or Power BI). I approached the data cleaning and transformations using Python (Jupyter Notebook),  mostly using the `pandas` library, and created visualizations on Tableau. Please see the attached `pptx.` file for a summary of compliance findings and business improvement recommendations.

## Solution Summary
* **Enhancing Discount Management Controls**: To improve discount application consistency across eligible customers and eligible discount windows (`discount_start_date` and `discount_end_date`)
* **Improving Data Accuracy & Integrity**: To improve data input audits, eliminate/reduce discount application discrepancies, and order processing processes.
* **Optimize Order Processing Systems**: To better integrate `Digital` and `CRM` systems, and to streamline the order processing process to automate data-entry
* **Implement a Targeted Revenue Assurance Dashboard**: To improve compliance visibility across relevant stakeholders
